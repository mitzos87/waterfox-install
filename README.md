- The waterfox.desktop file is adapted from the one on [Arch Linux's AUR waterfox-bin.git](https://aur.archlinux.org/cgit/aur.git/tree/waterfox.desktop?h=waterfox-bin). Here is the raw/text only version: [waterfox.desktop raw](https://aur.archlinux.org/cgit/aur.git/plain/waterfox.desktop?h=waterfox-bin).
  - Changes:
  Added to the [waterfox.desktop](https://github.com/msmafra/waterfox-install/blob/master/waterfox.desktop) the [TryExec key](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/desktop-entry-spec/latest/ar01s06.html) entry at line `85: + TryExec=/usr/lib64/waterfox/waterfox`  with the full path of the application and also `88: Icon=waterfox-icon => Icon=/usr/lib64/waterfox/browser/chrome/icons/default/default256.png` altered the [Icon key](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/desktop-entry-spec/latest/ar01s06.html) by adding the full path for the 256px x 256px png icon. To point to the icon with the best quality.

- /usr/bin/waterfox file is adapted from Fedora's version of /usr/bin/firefox as a base, to do a quick adaptation. File is installed by DNF package manager during the installation of Mozilla Firefox browser.

### Some Information
The installation script will, download waterfox-xx.xx.xx.en-US.linux-x86_64.tar.bz2 and extract it to /usr/lib64/, create a symbolic link in /usr/bin/, create a [desktop entry](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/desktop-entry-spec/latest/index.html) file (waterfox.desktp) on /usr/share/applications/. And there is no uninstallation yet.

## Using the script
### Getting the script

`git clone https://github.com/msmafra/waterfox-install.git`

### Uninstalling Waterfox

There is also a separated uninstallation file for the 0.x installation because of its place of installation /usr/lib64/. It will probably change on the next version to /opt/. Will be integrated in the final version.

## Newer Versions Of Waterfox

The script was pointing to the previous download page https://waterfoxproject.org/en-US/waterfox/new/?scene=1, which is not updated anymore. Actually https://waterfoxproject.org/ is now redirected to https://www.waterfox.net/. The new download page has now all OSes and also the possiblity to download the testing and production versions. The ability to choose between production and development version is not implemented in the current version 0.x but will be in 1.0.
